For this task, I participated in five airdrops from real Web3 projects: PublicAI, Gradient Network, OneFootball Club, Shaga, and MagicNewton. Each one required simple actions such as registering, exploring platform features, joining communities, or inviting users.

This experience allowed me to interact directly with different decentralized protocols, explore their tools, and understand how activity-based incentive systems work. It also helped me get more comfortable using wallets, staking, dApps, and referral systems. I realized that crypto goes far beyond centralized exchanges â€” there's a whole ecosystem of real applications and opportunities being built through Web3.

My favorite airdrop:
The one I enjoyed the most was Gradient Network, because I found their focus on open data, on-chain analytics, and developer tools really interesting. It aligns perfectly with my interests, especially in building and analyzing tools for tracking blockchain metrics and creating dApps focused on information.
